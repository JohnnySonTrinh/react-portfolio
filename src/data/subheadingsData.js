            mindset to software development. I design and build responsive,
            user-friendly applications with a focus on detail, adaptability, and
            seamless experiences. My work in AI training and senior review has
            sharpened my analytical eye and reinforced the importance of
            precision, efficiency, and scalable solutions.
